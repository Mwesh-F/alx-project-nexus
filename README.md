# ALX Project Nexus

This repository is dedicated to documenting major learnings from the ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering program. It serves as a knowledge hub, showcasing concepts, tools, best practices, and personal insights gained throughout the program.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Program Overview

The **ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering** program is a comprehensive learning experience designed to equip learners with modern frontend development skills. The program emphasizes hands-on learning, real-world projects, collaboration with backend developers, and professional growth.

---

## ðŸš€ Major Learnings

### ðŸ§© Key Technologies Covered

- **Next.js** â€“ for building full-stack React applications with server-side rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** â€“ statically typed superset of JavaScript for robust code.
- **GraphQL** â€“ an alternative to REST APIs that provides flexible and efficient data querying.
- **API Integration** â€“ consuming and integrating REST and GraphQL APIs.
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)** â€“ enabling web applications to work offline and be installable.
- **Mobile Development with React Native & Expo Router**

---

### ðŸ’¡ Important Concepts

- **System Design & Analysis** â€“ understanding architectural patterns, scalability, and planning.
- **State Management** â€“ using useState, Context API, Redux Toolkit.
- **Routing** â€“ both in Next.js and React Native with Expo Router.
- **Authentication & Authorization** â€“ managing user sessions and access control.
- **UI/UX Principles** â€“ wireframing, prototyping, and creating user-centric designs.

---

## ðŸ§  Challenges Faced & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Handling deeply nested state | Introduced Redux Toolkit for scalable and predictable state management. |
| Styling consistency | Used Tailwindâ€™s design tokens and utility classes to maintain a design system. |
| API errors and loading states | Implemented reusable API call utilities with loading and error boundaries. |
| Learning TypeScript from scratch | Practiced with small modules and converted JavaScript files gradually. |

---

## âœ… Best Practices & Takeaways

- Write **clean, maintainable code** with reusable components.
- Use **Git branches** and clear commit messages for version control.
- Document your **learning and decisions** throughout the project.
- Collaborate effectively with backend developers using **shared endpoints**.
- Never underestimate the power of **wireframing and planning before coding**.

  - No login required for voting or viewing results
- **Admin Tools:**
  - Backend management for contestants and vote synchronization
- **Modern UI:**
  - Responsive, mobile-friendly design
  - Built with Tailwind CSS and Recharts for beautiful charts

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Redux Toolkit, Recharts, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
- **Charts:** Recharts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- Python 3.10+
- Django 4+

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/Mwesh-F/alx-project-nexus.git
	cd alx-project-nexus
	```

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**
	```bash
	npm install
	```

3. **Install backend dependencies:**
	```bash
	cd authapi
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

4. **Sync contestants (from backend):**
	```bash
	python manage.py sync_contestants
	```

5. **Run the backend server:**
	```bash
	python manage.py runserver
	```

6. **Run the frontend (in project root):**
	```bash
	npm run dev
	```

## Usage

- Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the voting platform.
- View live results, vote for contestants, and see top contenders in real time.

## Project Structure

- `src/app/` â€” Next.js app directory (pages, results, voting UI)
- `src/store/` â€” Redux Toolkit slices and store
- `authapi/` â€” Django backend (API, models, management commands)
- `public/` â€” Static assets (contestant images, placeholder, etc.)

## Customization

- Add or update contestants via the Django admin or management commands.
- Update chart types or UI in `src/app/results/page.tsx` as needed.
