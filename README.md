## ðŸš€ Major Learnings

### ðŸ§© Key Technologies Covered

- **Next.js** â€“ for building full-stack React applications with server-side rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** â€“ statically typed superset of JavaScript for robust code.
- **GraphQL** â€“ an alternative to REST APIs that provides flexible and efficient data querying.
- **API Integration** â€“ consuming and integrating REST and GraphQL APIs.
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)** â€“ enabling web applications to work offline and be installable.
- **Mobile Development with React Native & Expo Router**

---

### ðŸ’¡ Important Concepts

- **System Design & Analysis** â€“ understanding architectural patterns, scalability, and planning.
- **State Management** â€“ using useState, Context API, Redux Toolkit.
- **Routing** â€“ both in Next.js and React Native with Expo Router.
- **Authentication & Authorization** â€“ managing user sessions and access control.
- **UI/UX Principles** â€“ wireframing, prototyping, and creating user-centric designs.

## ðŸ§  Challenges Faced & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Handling deeply nested state | Introduced Redux Toolkit for scalable and predictable state management. |
| Styling consistency | Used Tailwindâ€™s design tokens and utility classes to maintain a design system. |
| API errors and loading states | Implemented reusable API call utilities with loading and error boundaries. |
| Learning TypeScript from scratch | Practiced with small modules and converted JavaScript files gradually. |

## âœ… Best Practices & Takeaways

- Write **clean, maintainable code** with reusable components.
- Use **Git branches** and clear commit messages for version control.
- Document your **learning and decisions** throughout the project.
- Collaborate effectively with backend developers using **shared endpoints**.
- Never underestimate the power of **wireframing and planning before coding**.
